This folder contains three items that shows an early prototype of a portion of Group 11's app, specifically the information screen that will
educate the user on what he/she can do in order to control his/her bloodsugar. The methods highlighted are exercise and
diet. 

The three items on this folder are:
1. A screen shot of the app working through the android studio emulator.
2. The code of the program.
3. This read me file.

Thank you very much and have a nice day.
